Character Selection:

1 - Guy woke up in this dark room with nothing on him, Guy is an average guy.

2 - Blake has come looking for his friend, Guy. He is more prepared with 3 torches and is more fit than Guy.

3 - The Guard. He has plenty of torches.

4 - The Skeleton is very fast and clumsy, he has bones made of light, he cant take torches, only extinguish them. (this may not actually be true due to a bug.)

Let us know how many days you have chalked up, who can go the most days?

Any bugs? tell me!

I idle in the afternet #ludumdare, you can reach me there :D
